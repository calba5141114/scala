## Scala Playground
Scala is a Java-like programming language which unifies object-oriented and functional programming. It is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behavior of objects are described by classes. Classes can be composed using mixin composition. Scala is designed to work seamlessly with less pure but mainstream object-oriented languages like Java.

This is my Scala Playground stuff.
